# Scraping With Selenium:

**Objective:**
  * This Python script demonstrates web scraping using Selenium from an e-commerce website, specifically "https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/static/" or "https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html".
  * It scrapes laptop, clothes and others e-commerce product data from multiple pages based on user input.\
    
**Tools Used:**
  * Selenium WebDriver: Automates web browser interaction.
  * Python Libraries:\
    pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame creation.\
    time: For adding delays between actions.

**Steps:**\
WebDriver Setup:
  * Imports necessary modules and sets up the WebDriver with Chrome.
Navigation:
  * Navigates to the target webpage.
Data Scraping:
  * Finds and clicks on elements to access laptop listings.
  * Iterates over the specified number of pages.
  * Extracts laptop data such as name, price, description, and rating.
Data Processing:
  * Stores scraped data in a list of dictionaries.
  * Creates a pandas DataFrame from the list.
  * Outputs the DataFrame to an Excel file named "selenium_scraping_data.xlsx".

**Insights:**
  * Data Quantity: The script allows for scraping laptop data from multiple pages, providing a potentially large dataset.
  * Data Quality: By extracting attributes like name, price, description, and rating, detailed information about each laptop can be collected.
  * Automation: Utilizing Selenium WebDriver streamlines the scraping process, making it efficient and suitable for larger datasets.
  * Data Export: The scraped data is saved in an Excel file, facilitating easy access and further analysis.

This script serves as a practical example of web scraping with Selenium, showcasing its capabilities for extracting structured data from dynamic web pages.
